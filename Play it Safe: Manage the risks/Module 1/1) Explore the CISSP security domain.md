## Overview of the Eight CISSP Security Domains

Security teams use the **eight CISSP security domains** to organize tasks, identify gaps in security, and establish their **security posture**—the ability to manage defense of critical assets and data and react to change.

---

### **First Four Domains**

#### 1. **Security and Risk Management**
   - **Focus Areas**:
     - **Defining Security Goals and Objectives**: Reduce risks to critical assets and data (e.g., PII).
     - **Risk Mitigation**: Implement procedures to quickly reduce the impact of risks like breaches.
     - **Compliance**: Develop internal security policies, meet regulatory requirements, and adhere to independent standards.
     - **Business Continuity**: Maintain productivity by establishing disaster recovery plans.
     - **Legal Regulations**: Follow ethical rules to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud.

#### 2. **Asset Security**
   - **Focus**: Securing **digital and physical assets**, including data storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction.
   - **Key Practices**:
     - Protect sensitive data (e.g., PII, SPII) whether stored, transferred, or physically collected.
     - Implement policies for proper data handling, access control, and disposal.
     - **Example**: Overseeing the destruction of hard drives to prevent unauthorized access to private data.

#### 3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**
   - **Focus**: Optimizing data security through effective tools, systems, and processes.
   - **Core Concept**: **Shared Responsibility**—all individuals in the organization actively lower risk and maintain physical and virtual security.
   - **Key Practice**: Encourage users to recognize and report security concerns to handle issues quickly.

#### 4. **Communication and Network Security**
   - **Focus**: Managing and securing **physical networks** and **wireless communications**.
   - **Key Practices**:
     - Protect data and communications on-site, in the cloud, or during remote connections.
     - **Example**: Restrict insecure communication channels (e.g., public Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) to prevent vulnerabilities for remote employees.

### **Last Four Domains**

#### 5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - **Focus**: Managing access and authorization to keep data secure by ensuring users follow established policies.
   - **Goal**: Reduce overall risk to systems and data by limiting user access to only what employees need.
   - **Example**: Avoid using shared administrator logins to track user activity and prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Four Main Components**:
     1. **Identification**: Users verify their identity (e.g., username, access card, biometric data).
     2. **Authentication**: Verification process (e.g., password, PIN).
     3. **Authorization**: Determines the user's level of access based on their role.
     4. **Accountability**: Monitoring and recording user actions (e.g., login attempts) to ensure proper use of systems and data.

#### 6. **Security Assessment and Testing**
   - **Focus**: Conducting **security control testing**, collecting and analyzing data, and performing **security audits** to monitor risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
   - **Key Practices**:
     - Identify better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
     - Evaluate if current controls meet organizational goals.
     - Regularly collect and analyze security data to prevent threats.
   - **Example**: Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.

#### 7. **Security Operations**
   - **Focus**: Conducting **investigations** and implementing **preventative measures**.
   - **Key Steps**:
     1. **Incident Identification**: Detect and respond to security incidents urgently to minimize risks.
     2. **Threat Mitigation**: Neutralize active attacks to protect private information.
     3. **Forensic Investigation**: Collect digital and physical evidence to determine how, when, and why the breach occurred.
     4. **Preventative Measures**: Use findings to improve defenses and prevent future attacks.

#### 8. **Software Development Security**
   - **Focus**: Using **secure coding practices** to create secure applications and services.
   - **Key Practices**:
     - Integrate security into every phase of the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.
     - Perform security reviews during each phase:
       - **Design Phase**: Secure design review.
       - **Development and Testing Phases**: Secure code reviews.
       - **Deployment Phase**: Penetration testing.
   - **Goal**: Keep software secure, protect sensitive data, and mitigate unnecessary risks.
