# Core Skills for Cybersecurity Professionals

## Overview
To succeed in cybersecurity, professionals need a combination of **transferable skills** (skills applicable across various roles) and **technical skills** (specific knowledge and expertise). This chapter highlights the essential skills for a security analyst and emphasizes how diverse backgrounds and experiences can enhance these skills.

## Transferable Skills

### 1. **Communication**
   - Security analysts must effectively communicate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to individuals without technical backgrounds.
   - Examples: Interpreting and explaining policies, reporting findings to supervisors, and recommending security measures.

### 2. **Collaboration**
   - Analysts often work in teams with engineers, digital forensic investigators, and program managers.
   - Example: Collaborating on projects like rolling out new security features with cross-functional teams.

### 3. **Analytical Thinking**
   - Analysts analyze complex scenarios and recommend tools or strategies to improve efficiency and safeguard networks.
   - Example: Evaluating how different tools can enhance security and productivity.

### 4. **Problem-Solving**
   - Identifying, diagnosing, and resolving security issues is critical to maintaining business operations.
   - Example: Understanding threat actors and identifying trends to mitigate future risks.

## Technical Skills

### 1. **Programming Languages**
   - Basic knowledge of programming languages (e.g., Python, SQL) helps automate tasks and identify error messages.
   - This program assumes no prior programming experience and provides hands-on practice.

### 2. **SIEM Tools**
   - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools are used to identify, analyze, and respond to security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
   - Example: Using SIEM tools to detect unauthorized system access.

### 3. **Computer Forensics**
   - Digital forensic investigators identify, analyze, and preserve criminal evidence within networks, computers, and electronic devices.
   - Example: Investigating incidents involving unauthorized access or data breaches.
