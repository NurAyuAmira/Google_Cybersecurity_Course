In this activity, you will review the professional statement outline to create a professional statement that you can include as part of your cybersecurity portfolio documentation. Previously, you learned about options for creating and hosting a cybersecurity portfolio.

A professional statement is an introduction to employers that briefly describes who you are and what you care about. It allows you to showcase your interest in cybersecurity, work experience, knowledge, skills, and achievements. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity concepts, you can return to this professional statement and revise it as needed.

To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/supplement/RTDuH/create-a-cybersecurity-portfolio).

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

Step 2: Draft your professional statement

Your professional statement is your opportunity to show prospective employers who you are as a person and potential employee, and it allows them to understand the value you can bring to the organization.

_**Note:**_ _You will not submit/upload your professional statement directly into this activity; you will need to download/save it to your own device. Then, upload it to the portfolio platform/site of your choice when it’s ready to share with potential employers._

Use these guidelines to develop your draft professional statement:

1.  Use your own device to open a word processing document or application (or use a blank piece of paper).
    
2.  Refer to your professional statement outline notes from step one and consider:
    
    1.  What are your strengths (ones you currently have or plan to develop)?
        
    2.  What are your values?
        
    3.  What interests you most about a career in cybersecurity?
        
    4.  How can your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the security goals of various organizations?
        
3.  Draft a two- to three-sentence professional statement that includes details about your strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity, as well as how they can support the security goals of various organizations.
    

Refer to the following professional statement examples for ideas:

_**Example A:**_ _I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike._

_**Example B:**_ _I am enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk._

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity:

-   Be intentional about how you want to be perceived by potential employers.
    
-   Include your strengths and values, and be genuine about why you want to enter the cybersecurity profession.
    
-   Regularly update your statement to reflect your growing professional skills and knowledge.
    

### **Step 4: Assess your activity**

Following is the self-assessment for your professional statement. You will use these statements to review your own work. The self-assessment process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to _objectively_ assess your professional statement.

There are a total of 5 points possible for this activity and each statement is worth 1 point. The items correspond to each step you completed for the activity.

To complete the self-assessment, first open your professional statement. Then respond yes or no to each statement.

When you complete and submit your responses, you will receive a percentage score. This score will help you confirm whether you completed the required steps of the activity. The recommended passing grade for this project is at least 80% (or 4/5 points). If you want to increase your score, you can revise your project and then resubmit your responses to reflect any changes you made. Try to achieve at least 4 points before continuing on to the next course item.
