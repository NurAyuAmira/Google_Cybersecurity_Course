# Introduction to security frameworks and controls

1. **Purpose of Security Frameworks**:
   - Guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
   - Provide a structured approach to implementing a **security lifecycle** (policies, standards, and compliance).

2. **Core Components of Security Frameworks**:
   - **1. Identifying and Documenting Security Goals**:
     - Example: Aligning with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for data protection.
   - **2. Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals**:
     - Example: Developing policies for handling user data requests under GDPR.
   - **3. Implementing Strong Security Processes**:
     - Example: Designing procedures to comply with verified user data requests (e.g., updating or deleting profile information).
   - **4. Monitoring and Communicating Results**:
     - Example: Monitoring the network and reporting potential GDPR compliance issues.

3. **Security Controls**:
   - Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
   - Example: Requiring employees to complete privacy training to reduce data breach risks.
   - Analysts may use tools to track compliance with security controls.

4. **Importance of Frameworks and Controls**:
   - Essential for managing organizational security and maintaining low risk levels.
   - Help analysts support security goals and protect data and users.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Explore well-known frameworks and principles to minimize risk and protect data.
