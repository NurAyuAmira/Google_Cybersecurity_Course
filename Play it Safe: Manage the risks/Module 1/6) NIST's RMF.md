## NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** provides frameworks to help security professionals manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. The **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is one such framework, consisting of **seven steps**. While entry-level analysts may not engage in all steps, understanding this framework is crucial for managing risks effectively and standing out in the job market.

### **Seven Steps of the RMF**

1. **Prepare**:
   - **Focus**: Activities to manage security and privacy risks **before a breach occurs**.
   - **Entry-Level Role**: Monitor for risks and identify controls to reduce them.

2. **Categorize**:
   - **Focus**: Develop risk management processes and tasks by considering how risks impact the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of systems and information.
   - **Entry-Level Role**: Follow organizational processes to reduce risks to critical assets (e.g., private customer information).

3. **Select**:
   - **Focus**: Choose, customize, and document controls to protect the organization.
   - **Example**: Keeping playbooks updated or managing documentation to address issues efficiently.

4. **Implement**:
   - **Focus**: Execute security and privacy plans to minimize the impact of ongoing risks.
   - **Example**: Changing password requirements if employees frequently need password resets.

5. **Assess**:
   - **Focus**: Determine if controls are implemented correctly and meet organizational needs.
   - **Entry-Level Role**: Identify weaknesses and recommend changes to tools, procedures, and controls.

6. **Authorize**:
   - **Focus**: Be accountable for security and privacy risks in the organization.
   - **Entry-Level Role**: Generate reports, develop action plans, and establish project milestones aligned with security goals.

7. **Monitor**:
   - **Focus**: Continuously observe system operations to ensure they support security goals.
   - **Entry-Level Role**: Assess and maintain technical operations daily, ensuring systems minimize risks.

### Importance of the RMF
- While entry-level analysts may not establish procedures, they play a key role in ensuring these procedures work as intended.
- Minimizing risks to the organization and the people it serves is a critical responsibility.
