**The CIA Triad:**

* The CIA triad is a core security model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
* The three components of the CIA triad are: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Confidentiality:**

* Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
* Sensitive data should be available on a "need to know" basis.

**Integrity:**

* Integrity means that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
* Determining the integrity of data and analyzing how it's used will help you decide whether the data can or cannot be trusted.

**Availability:**

* Availability means that the data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
* Ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are functioning properly to allow for timely and reliable access is a key responsibility for security professionals.

**Actionable Takeaways:**
