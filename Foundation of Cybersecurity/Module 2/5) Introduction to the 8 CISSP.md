# Introduction to Security Domains (CISSP)

1. **Overview**:
   - Security domains organize core security concepts.
   - Defined by CISSP (8 domains as of 2022).
   - Domains are interrelated; gaps in one can impact the entire organization.
   - Understanding domains helps identify career goals and roles.

2. **CISSP Domains**:
   - **1. Security and Risk Management**:
     - Focus: Defining security goals, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal requirements.
     - Example: Updating company policies to comply with regulations like HIPAA.

   - **2. Asset Security**:
     - Focus: Securing digital and physical assets, including data storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction.
     - Example: Ensuring proper disposal of old equipment containing confidential information.

   - **3. Security Architecture and Engineering**:
     - Focus: Optimizing data security through effective tools, systems, and processes.
     - Example: Configuring firewalls to monitor and filter network traffic, preventing attacks.

   - **4. Communication and Network Security**:
     - Focus: Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
     - Example: Creating policies to prevent users from connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots.

   - **5. Identity and Access Management**:
     - Focus: Ensuring data security by managing user access to physical (e.g., office spaces) and logical assets (e.g., networks, applications).
     - Example: Setting up keycard access for employees to secure buildings.

   - **6. Security Assessment and Testing**:
     - Focus: Testing security controls, analyzing data, and conducting audits to identify risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
     - Example: Auditing user permissions to ensure only authorized employees access sensitive data (e.g., payroll information).

   - **7. Security Operations**:
     - Focus: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures to address threats.
     - Example: Responding to alerts about unknown devices connected to the internal network and following policies to mitigate risks.

   - **8. Software Development Security**:
     - Focus: Applying secure coding practices to create secure applications and services.
     - Example: Advising development teams on password policies or ensuring user data is securely managed in a new mobile app.

3. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Security is a team effort with many moving parts.
   - Entry-level analysts develop skills to mitigate risks and protect people and data.
   - No need to be an expert in all domains, but a basic understanding is essential for growth as a security professional.
