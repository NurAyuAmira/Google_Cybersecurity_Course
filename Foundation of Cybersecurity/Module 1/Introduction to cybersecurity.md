# Introduction to Cybersecurity

## Overview
Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity, the roles of security professionals, and the importance of preparing for and mitigating security threats.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Preparing for the Storm**
   - Just as you prepare for a physical storm by securing your home and gathering essential supplies, organizations must prepare for cybersecurity threats.
   - Security teams ensure they have the tools and processes in place to mitigate risks and respond quickly to threats, minimizing potential damage.

### 2. **What is Cybersecurity?**
   - Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or exploitation.
   - Examples include requiring **complex passwords** to improve confidentiality and prevent threat actors from compromising systems.

### 3. **Threats**
   - **External Threats**: Individuals or groups outside the organization attempting to access private information, networks, or devices.
   - **Internal Threats**: Risks from current or former employees, vendors, or partners. These can be accidental (e.g., clicking a malicious link) or intentional (e.g., unauthorized data access).

### 4. **Roles of Security Teams**
   - **Mitigate Threats**: Reduce the impact of both external and internal threats.
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the organization meets laws and guidelines for security standards, avoiding fines and audits.
   - **Business Continuity**: Maintain productivity even during incidents like data breaches.
   - **Cost Reduction**: Minimize expenses related to data loss, downtime, or fines.
   - **Brand Trust**: Protect customer data and services to maintain trust and avoid long-term damage to the organization's reputation.
