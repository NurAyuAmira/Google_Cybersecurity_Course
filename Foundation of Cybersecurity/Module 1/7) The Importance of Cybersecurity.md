### 3. **Risks of Data Breaches**

### 4. **Growing Demand for Security Professionals**
   - Organizations and government entities need security professionals to manage risks and protect data, products, and people.
   - The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a **30% growth** in demand for security professionals by 2030.
