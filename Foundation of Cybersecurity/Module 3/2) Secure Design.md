# Secure Design

1. **CIA Triad**:
   - Foundational model for managing risk in systems and security policies.
   - **CIA** stands for:
     - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
       - Example: Strict access controls to protect sensitive data.
     - **Integrity**: Ensuring data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
       - Example: Using encryption to prevent data tampering.
     - **Availability**: Ensuring data is accessible to authorized users.

2. **Asset**:
   - An item perceived as having value to an organization.
   - Value is determined by the cost associated with the asset.
   - Example: An application storing sensitive data (e.g., social security numbers) is a high-value asset requiring tighter security controls.

3. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**:
   - A voluntary framework developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   - Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
   - Used by security teams as a baseline for managing short and long-term risks.

4. **Threat Actors**:
   - **Disgruntled Employees**: Among the most dangerous threat actors due to their access to sensitive information.
   - **Mitigation**: Use the principle of availability and organizational guidelines to restrict access to only necessary data.

5. **Diverse Workforce**:
   - A diverse team of security professionals helps identify attackers' intentions and mitigate malicious activity.

6. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Understanding the CIA triad and NIST CSF is essential for securing organizational assets.
   - These frameworks and principles are often discussed in job interviews and applied in real-world scenarios.
